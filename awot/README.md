# Automated Web of Trust (awot)
## What it is
A fully decentralized solution to the Public-Key Distribution Problem.

## Why it exists
Using crypto is great, but advertising public keys in IP network is prone to impersonation or man in the middle attacks.
AWOT provides uses an implicit underlying social network to detect and avoid problems such as collision of keys (two keys for a given user) or sibyl attacks.
This allows to obtain public keys from trusted peers and redistribute them, while recording how much "trust" one put on those keys.
